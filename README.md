<h1> Nice to meet you üßã </h1>
<p> I'm Barnatt, an undergraduate student stuyding computer science at Stevens Institute of Technology. <br>
My goal is to become a full-stack engineer so I've been soaking in as much new technologies and knowledge I can. <br>
This summer I have planned out an event-driven microservice chat application to develop with a couple of my friends.
</p>

<p><b>My Story</b><br>
During the whole college fiasco, I was conflicted. It was difficult between choosing to studying computer science <br>
or choosing to pursue my passion in the arts. In hindsight, it wasn't a difficult choice. But I still felt uneasy <br>
because I did not have the same level of experience in programming as my peers. Over the past few months, I have been <br>
working hard so that I can reach my goals. 
</p>

<p><b>The Future</b><br>
Learning web Dev and software architectures has been a fun chapter, but I want to branch out to other operating systems and mediums, in particular, <br>
mobile dev, data science, machine learning & AI, as well as game dev. I want to dip my toes in as much fields <br>
as I can and get a feel for what I enjoy the most. In the near future I will be: <br><br>
    - Learning machine learning and data science with Python <br>
    - Learning Kotlin and Andriod Studio for mobile dev
</p>
