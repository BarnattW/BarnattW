<h1> Nice to meet you üßã </h1>
<p> I'm Barnatt, an undergraduate student studying computer science at Stevens Institute of Technology. <br>
</p>

<p><b>My Story</b><br>
During the whole college fiasco, I was conflicted. It was difficult between choosing to studying computer science <br>
or choosing to pursue my passion in the arts. In hindsight, it wasn't a difficult choice. But I still felt uneasy <br>
because I did not have the same level of experience in programming as my peers. Over the past few months, I have been <br>
working hard so that I can reach my goals. 
</p>

<p><b>The Future</b><br>
Learning web Dev and software architectures has been a fun chapter, but I want to branch out to other operating systems and mediums, in particular, <br>
mobile dev, data science, machine learning & AI, as well as game dev. I want to dip my toes in as much fields <br>
as I can and get a feel for what I enjoy the most. <br>
I made a decision recently to pursue game development with Unreal Engine, and I've been focused much of my time and energy towards that goal.
